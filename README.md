# MSACO
This is my attempt to solve Quota Travelling Salesman with Incomplete Rides using Multi Strategy Ant Colony Optimization.
It implements the Multi Strategy ACO to find the best path, using the following heuristics:
- Cost
- Time
- Quota
- Passengers

It then implements the Ride Matching Algorithm to find the reduced cost with passengers.

Update: Now, it also keeps track of the previous day best path. So, the previous day best path will also effect the path of the current day.
